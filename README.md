- 👋 Hi, I’m @TonyMottram
- 👀 I’m interested in computer gaming but want to make rather than play them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript to get me off the blocks, and have signed up to 'The Odin Project', 'Freecodecamp' and 'Kham Academy'
- in order to acheive my goal
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects when I feel confident enough to contribute but as of the moment (Septrmber 2023) I have a steep
- learning curve to conquer.
- 📫 I can be contacted via tony.mottram@rocketmail.com
